SwiftKey-Natural-language
=========================

Around the world, people are spending an increasing amount of time on their mobile devices for email, social networking, banking and a whole range of other activities. But typing on mobile devices can be a serious pain. 

SwiftKey, our corporate partner in this capstone, builds a smart keyboard that makes it easier for people to type on their mobile devices. One cornerstone of their smart keyboard is predictive text models. 

##### Tips:
1. P=C(p|w1-w4)/C(w1-w4)
2. Smooth (Katz's back-off model with Good-Turing frequency estimation)
3. Sort
4. Remove longer grams that predict the same results as shorter grams
5. hash reduce size
6. 4grams->3->2->1gram
7. Shiny

Data Science Specialization
========================================================

This is the master respository containing my work for the [Coursera Data Science][1] Specialization.
Each of the subdirectories correpsond to a different course and are self-contained. The official repository for the specialization can be found [here][2].

## Data Scientist's Toolbox
The first course of the specialization is to orient you on the definition of a Data Scientist proposed by the 3 instructors ([Brian Caffo][3], [Jeff Leek][4] and [Roger Peng][5]). Further information on there general philosophys can be found on their personal websites and a repository found [here][6]. The objectives for the [Data Scientist's Toolbox][7] were to set expectations for the Coursera Specialization and to gain familiarity with GitHub and Rmarkdown.

## R Programming
The course in [R Programming][8] involved familiarizing you with [R][9] and [RStudio][10]. This course involved two minor programming assignments to demonstrate R programming. My primary files for the course can be round [here][11]. The second programming assignment is part of a fork and can be found [here][12].

## Getting and Cleaning Data
The course in [Getting and Cleaning Data][13] involves learning methods to generate "tidy" datasets. The exercises involving this course can be found [here][14].

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The course in [Exploratory Data Analysis][15] gives an overview of the basic R plot function, the lattice package and ggplot.

## Reproducible Research
The course in [Reproducible Research][16]  and introduces the use of [Rpubs][17]. My Rpubs report for this class can be found [here][18].

## Statistical Inference
The course in [Statistical Inference][19] gave a brief overview of statisitics's and their corresponding assumptions. This course was graded using quizzes.

## Regression Models
The course in [Regression Models][20] gave an overview of possible statistical models for various analysis. My course project can be found [here][21]

## Practical Machine Learning
The course in [Practical Machine Learning][22] provided an overview in how to design machine learning experiments and demonstrated the capabilities of the caret package in R. My associated project for this course can be found [here][23].

## Developing Data Products
The course in [Developing Data Products][24] introduces Rpresenter, shiny, and slidify. My final project for this course involved generating a [shinyApp][25] with an accompanying [presentation][26]. The code for this project can be found [here][27].

## Data Science Capstone
The specialization was finished with the [Data Science Capstone][28]. This capstone project involved handling a large data set of mined text (~1.5GB) and generating a word prediction application. Along the development of the program was a [Milestone Report][29]. The capstone was completed with a final [presentation][30] and working [application][31]. The corresponding code can be found [here][32].
